# 🧠 Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) in C

Welcome to my repository on **Design and Analysis of Algorithms**!  
This repo contains a collection of classic and essential algorithm implementations in C — perfect for understanding the core concepts behind problem-solving and optimization.

## 📚 Topics Covered

✔️ Sorting Algorithms  
✔️ Searching Algorithms  
✔️ Greedy Algorithms  
✔️ Divide and Conquer  
✔️ Dynamic Programming  
✔️ Backtracking  
✔️ Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim, etc.)  
✔️ NP-Completeness basics (e.g., Travelling Salesman Problem)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To compile and run the programs, you need a C compiler like `gcc`.  
You can install it via:
```bash
sudo apt install gcc        # On Ubuntu/Debian
brew install gcc            # On macOS
